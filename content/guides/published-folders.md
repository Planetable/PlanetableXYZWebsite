## Publish Local Folders as IPNS

Easily publish local folders using the built-in IPFS node.

Find this feature in the menu under: Tools -> Published Folders

Once your folder has been successfully published, simply copy its IPNS for convenient sharing. Other Planet users will be able to load the IPNS with their [local gateway](@/guides/local-gateway.md).

## Working with Other Static Site Generators

You can use this feature to publish a static site built with a static site generator like Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo, or Zola. Just publish their build folder as IPNS. You can even enable `Automatically Publish` to monitor any changes and publish when a change is detected.

For example, here is a Jekyll site published as an IPNS:

* IPNS: <small><a href="https://k51qzi5uqu5dk40pdgrqh5e6soy2bide88stdbkx8h7jjwvo5cb3xbkb2b7wmq.ipns.gateway.v2ex.pro/" target="_blank">k51qzi5uqu5dk40pdgrqh5e6soy2bide88stdbkx8h7jjwvo5cb3xbkb2b7wmq</a></small>
